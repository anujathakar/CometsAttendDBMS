Building a SQL-based Database Management System (DBMS) for university student attendance tracking involved tasks such as designing a database schema, creating tables, populating data, querying for insights, ensuring data maintenance, and optimizing for performance. The key learnings include database design principles, SQL commands for manipulation and querying, security implementation, and optimization techniques and designing a prototype of the user front end. This project provided practical experience in developing and managing databases.
